## üìå Dev Hero Meetup Circles Cohort

*‚ÄúLearn. Connect. Build. In Your City.‚Äù*

### üîç What is it?

**Dev Hero Meetup Circles** is a 3-month offline meetup series hosted and led by the **AWS UG Leaders**, **AWS Cloud Clubs**, **AWS Community Builders**, and other AWS-aligned community influencers across India. The meetups are independently executed but aligned with the **Amazon Q adoption goals** of Devsphere.

Each meetup will include informal sessions on AI tooling, community use-case sharing, and Q-based productivity demonstrations. While content will remain **creator-driven**, Devsphere will support logistics like **swag kits**, social templates, and **cohort access** to these meetups for additional learning and networking.
